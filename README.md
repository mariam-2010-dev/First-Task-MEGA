## Why I Used `<dl>` instead of `<ul>`?
I used `<dl>` (Description List) for the Skills section because each skill has
**a title (term) and a description**. `<dl>` allows pairing each term (`<dt>`)
with its definition (`<dd>`), which is semantically correct.  
Using `<ul>` would only list items without distinguishing between the skill name and its description.
